%\chapter*{Abstract}
%Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most aggressive and frequent form of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), is a chronic and life-threatening disease of unknown cause. It is characterised by progressive worsening of dyspnea and other lung function and is associated with a poor prognosis. IPF occurs primarily in middle-aged and elderly adults, and is more frequent in males than females. Even worse, the aetiology of IPF remains elusive, and its progression is variable and unpredictable, hence there are no biomarkers that can indicate the likely progression of the disease. A quantification scheme that allows recognition of disease consistently across radiology, pulmonary and pathology disciplines remains difficult. In this study, a combination of quantitative information extracted from \gls{hrct}, clinical knowledge, and computational modelling was used to help develop a better understanding of the progression of IPF.
%
%First, an automatic lung lobe segmentation method from HRCT images was developed, which is guided by a statistical shape model that can predict the likely region of fissure locations. This new method was able to estimate the fissure location in 100\% of cases including both normal healthy and IPF subjects, whereas two comparison segmentation softwares that use anatomy-based methods fail in several cases. Second, tissue abnormalities in a cohort of IPF lungs were classified, and then mapped to a statistical shape model, and quantitative approaches were used to analyse lung shape, tissue density, tissue volume, the spatial distribution of abnormalities, and regional changes in tissue over time. Fibrosis was found to present predominantly basally and peripherally in the lung. In contrast, emphysema in these subjects was mostly located in the upper lobes. The first principal statistical shape mode (explaining $>20\%$ of the shape variation in normal lungs) is significantly different between IPF and normal and is strongly correlated with fibrosis extent in IPF. Finally, a computational model of lung function was developed which integrates quantification analysis from volumetric CT and pulmonary function test data to understand differences between IPF and normal older lungs. Ventilation ($\dot{V}$), perfusion (($\dot{Q}$)) and gas exchange models were parameterized to simulate $\dot{V}$ and $\dot{Q}$ distributions and $O_2$ and $CO_2$ exchange. The computational model can reasonably predict the patient-specific ventilation, perfusion and gas exchange in IPF lung, and quantify the difference of lung function between IPF patients and older normal people. However, abnormalities on volumetric CT imaging may be not able to provide enough information to explain the decline of lung function in IPF patient, and an individual impaired gas exchange appears to happen in not only abnormally tagged region but also in CT-visualized 'normal' tissues.
%
%IPF is a complex and progressive disease that has multifarious physiological processes and significant individual differences. The methods and models presented in this thesis provide a basis for application to research in IPF lung function, and furthers investigations into the underlying relationship between physiological mechanisms and disease progression of IPF.

%\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
%I would like to use this opportunity to express my gratitude to everyone who contributed to this research and supported me throughout my PhD. 
%
%First and foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my supervisor Professor Merryn Tawhai, Dr Alys Clark and  Dr Haribalan Kumar for the tremendous patience, motivation, enthusiasm, and immense knowledge. Their continuous guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis. This thesis would not be completed without their valuable advice and unfailing trust. It is my great honour to be their student and to have worked under their supervision.
%
%I would like to thank Brian Bartholmai from Mayo Clinic for providing CALIPER classification data, and thank Dr David Milne and Dr Margaret Wilsher from Auckland Hospital for providing the CT image data of IPF patients. Without their constant assistance, this research would not have been possible.
%
%I am also great thankful for the amazing people of lung and placenta groups: Mahyar, Hamed, Zay, Amir, Luca, Behdad, Toby, Kelly, Kerry, Rojan, Win, Mabelle and Izza. My special thanks goes to my lovely friends: Nancy, Wendy and Si. Thank you for giving me so much help, warm and happiness during my PhD.
%
%A big thank to my family for supporting me spiritually throughout my life. Last but not the least, my deepest gratitude to my beloved husband, Xinjian. Thanks for accompanying me, encouraging me, supporting me and loving me. Words would never say how grateful I am to you. Thank you!
